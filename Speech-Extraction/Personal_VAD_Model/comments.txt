- For each speaker create .flac audio files:
    - in project they have ca. 60 for each speaker
    - should i differentiate one streamer in different streams?
- For each created .flac file i need corresponding transcription and alignment:
    - transcription is possible with Whisper AI
    - alignments is list of every word and its end time:
        - https://github.com/CorentinJ/librispeech-alignments
        - empty words are used to represent silence


- Where to look for the files?
    - at the beginning they are not dead yet -> just streamer
    - in long movement phases?
    - detect phases in which there is single speaker speech via pyannote?
